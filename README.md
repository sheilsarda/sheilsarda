### Hello, this is Sheil

I'm an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania studying computer science, and minoring in linguistics. I'm a published machine learning researcher in Penn's NLP Group and I also teach a course in Penn's computer science department!

Outside of school, I'm a Managing Partner at a venture capital firm named Dorm Room Fund and a Quantitative Researcher at [Vise](https://vise.com). I also do consulting and contracting work with a variety of organizations, ranging from Y Combinator backed startups to R&D/defense companies.

Other than that, I love brewing coffee, skateboarding, and birdwatching!
